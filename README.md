The current study strategy is to copy the transcription of a lecture and go
through it a few times to map out what are the conceps that they are talking
about. This also helps us build the "story" or logical progression of an idea.

make sure to also:
* remove unnecessary comments
* add questions that pop up on each pass of the text.
* mark out the blocks where the professor is addressing questions in the lecture
* for every topic that is mentioned create a new org file. (topics/<insert name here>.org)
